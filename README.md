# Sentinel

**Know what's running on your Mac.**

Sentinel watches your processes, open ports, and network connections. When something looks unusual it tells you exactly what it found and **why** — no cloud account, no root access, no noise.

## Live monitor

![Overview tab — stats, findings, and live activity stream](docs/screenshots/overview.png)

Run `sentinel` to open the interactive live monitor. Press `?` for help, `s` to rescan, `1–7` to switch tabs.

---

## Install

**Requires macOS 14+, Python 3.12+**

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EyuelAbebe/sentinel.git
cd sentinel
pip install poetry && poetry install
```

Verify:

```bash
poetry run sentinel doctor
```

> **Tip:** run `source .venv/bin/activate` once so you can type `sentinel` directly without the `poetry run` prefix.

> For pip, pipx, and upgrade instructions see [docs/installation.md](docs/installation.md).

---

## Quick start

```bash
sentinel scan        # one-shot security scan
sentinel             # open interactive live monitor (TUI)
sentinel serve       # start HTTP API + browser dashboard on :7173
```

### Run as a background service (auto-start at login)

```bash
poetry install --extras api   # install the API server dependency
sentinel service install      # register with launchd and start at login
```

Manage it:

```bash
sentinel service status       # running? PID? API reachable?
sentinel service stop         # stop without uninstalling
sentinel service start        # start again
sentinel service restart      # restart (e.g. after an upgrade)
sentinel service uninstall    # remove from launchd entirely
```

## TUI screens

### Apps — all processes, flagged by severity

![Apps tab — running processes with severity flags and detail panel](docs/screenshots/apps.png)

### Network — listening ports and active connections side by side

![Network tab — listening ports and active connections](docs/screenshots/network.png)

### Findings — what was flagged and why

![Findings tab — findings sorted by severity with reason detail](docs/screenshots/findings.png)

### Search — filter across all processes, ports, and connections

![Search tab — live filter across processes, ports, and connections](docs/screenshots/search.png)

### Users — who is running what

![Users tab — user accounts and the processes running under them](docs/screenshots/users.png)

### Resources — CPU, memory, and disk at a glance

![Resources tab — system resource metrics and top processes](docs/screenshots/resources.png)

## Browser dashboard

Run `sentinel serve` then open **http://localhost:7173** in any browser.

![Browser dashboard — overview](docs/screenshots/dashboard-overview.png)

The dashboard polls `/scan` every 30 seconds and streams live events over WebSocket. No login, no setup.

**Network**

**Processes**

**Findings**

**Activity feed**

</details>

**API endpoints** (same port as the dashboard):

| Endpoint | Description |
|---|---|
| `GET /` | Browser dashboard |
| `GET /scan` | Run scan and return JSON |
| `GET /findings` | Query persisted findings from SQLite |
| `GET /baseline` | List baseline entries |
| `GET /health` | Liveness probe |
| `WS /events` | Stream live domain events |

---

## What gets flagged

| Signal | Severity |
|---|---|
| Listening on all interfaces (`0.0.0.0` / `::`) | MEDIUM |
| All-interfaces listener + suspicious executable path | HIGH |
| Running from `~/Downloads`, `/tmp`, `/var/tmp` | MEDIUM |
| Executable no longer exists on disk | HIGH |

Every finding shows the exact signals that triggered it. Sentinel never says "unknown = dangerous."

## Key bindings (TUI)

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `1` – `7` | Switch tabs |
| `←` `→` | Cycle tabs |
| `↑` `↓` | Navigate rows |
| `s` | Rescan now |
| `p` | Pause / resume live monitoring |
| `/` | Jump to Search |

## Permissions

Sentinel runs as a normal user — no root, no admin, no special entitlements.

| What | Without root | With `sudo` |
|---|---|---|
| Your own processes | All | All |
| System processes | Partial | All |
| Port owners (SIP-protected) | Partial | All |

Run `sentinel doctor` to see exactly what is visible in your environment.
